## Mardi Gras 2026

After two years of wearing nothing more ambitious than a teal Mardi Gras sweater, this year I wanted a Mardi Gras outfit that looked homemade and intentional, something that could hold its own among the wildly creative costumes you see all over New Orleans on Mardi Gras Day. 

Instead of starting with a fully formed concept, I used ChatGPT like a design partner first for concept directions, material suggestions, and then for mockups and stencil-ready artwork.

This article is going to walk through a few examples of the queries and model responses I thought made the biggest impact.  

Here's what I want you to take away from this: this costume is not winning any awards on Mardi Gras Day. It's not even close to the most impressive or wildest thing walking around the French Quarter. But I went from "I have an old jumpsuit and want to use gold paint" to a finished, intentional-looking costume in a few weeks and I could not have done it at that level without AI. Not because any single step was impossible on my own, but because AI compressed the whole process. Materials research, concept directions, mockups, stencil-ready artwork, painting technique, it kept the full context of my project across every step and let me iterate fast enough to actually get it done. And honestly, after doing the physical work of painting, cutting, and heat-setting, I'm kind of amazed I finished at all.

## Example #1 - What kind of Materials Will I Need? 

As someone who tries to encourage people to use AI tools, one piece of advice I emphasize is that it's important to bring the right kind of direction or constraint to the AI tool to get the best results for your situation.

I had a old mechanic jumpsuit from a Halloween costume from years ago and I knew I wanted to use gold paint in the costume. That meant the gold paint and any other colors needed to work on dark fabric along whatever kind of fabric the jumpsuit was made out of. 

I enabled internet search for this query, it ended up doing searching through over 20 websites including product descriptions, reddit threads, essays, and other sites that related to the query. It's really impressive how much ground a query can cover with one chat with the AI tools enabled with web search. 

user:
I live in New Orleans and I need to make a Mardi Gras Day outfit. They’re usually homemade clothes or costumes. I have this dark blue jumpsuit that looks like a mechanic’s jumpsuit thing and I am thinking that I might do a combo of painting on it, can you help me figure out the best kind of paint I can use to make it look good and last as long as possible?

ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking:
Perfect — your tag says the jumpsuit is 65% polyester / 35% cotton. That’s the key detail: polyester-heavy fabric is where a lot of “normal” craft fabric paints start to crack/flake or wash down, unless you use the right kind and heat-set it well.

Best paint route for a 65/35 poly/cotton jumpsuit (dark blue)

1) Best all-around (durable + good coverage on dark): Jacquard Textile Color + Neopaque/Lumiere
	•	Jacquard Textile Color is made to actually bond on synthetics/blends, not just cotton.
	•	For dark blue, you’ll want opaque paints:
	•	Neopaque for solid bright blocks (purple/green/gold will pop)
	•	Lumiere for metallics (gold is chef’s kiss on navy)

This combo is my #1 recommendation for “looks good, survives Mardi Gras, survives washing.”
...

## Example #2 - What Ideas Should I Explore? 

Since I knew I wanted to use gold, naturally I was thinking about how to incorporate a gold chain into the design. This was the basis for the next question, wondering how to incorporate this into a larger idea that could apply to other designs for the costume.

user:
I’m still brainstorming at this point but I was thinking I could paint big gold chain links around the neck and start from there. I like the idea of gold and purple highlights. What else might look good?

ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking:
On a dark blue jumpsuit, big simple shapes + metallic/opaque paint + a few high-contrast accents will look intentional (and not like craft paint smeared on workwear).

Your big gold chain links around the neck is a strong anchor. A few directions that pair really well with that:

1) “Royal mechanic / pit crew” (my favorite for this garment)
	•	Gold chain collar (your idea)
	•	Add gold “rank stripes” on the sleeves (like a captain’s jacket), plus purple bars between stripes
	•	A big back graphic: “KREWE CREW” or your name in varsity block letters
	•	Small detail: fleur-de-lis on one chest pocket in purple with a thin gold outline

Why it works: the jumpsuit already reads “uniform,” so you’re just upgrading it to “Mardi Gras uniform.”

2) “Gold hardware” theme (lean into the mechanic vibe)

Make the suit look like it has fancy “metal parts”:
	•	Along the zipper: paint a gold “exaggerated zipper teeth” strip (easy stencil)
	•	On pockets: paint gold rivets / bolts (circles with a tiny highlight)
	•	Add purple piping lines (thin stripes) along seams to mimic tailored trim

Why it works: it matches the jumpsuit’s structure and looks pro even if you’re not a painter.

...

What really caught my eye in the response was the "royal mechanic / pit crew" idea because the jumpsuit already reads like a uniform. bold shapes, a few repeating symbols, and contrasting accents that can be read from a distance. That became my filter for every idea after that: if it didn’t look like an upgraded “uniform,” I dropped it.

## Example #3 - Visualizing the Ideas

After going back and forth a few times refining various imagery that might be interesting to include in the costume. I thought it was time to get an idea of what the ideas might look like. 

user:
Can you generate a picture with some of these ideas?

ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking:

From the image generated, the ideas that stuck with me were the patches it included and the wrench with a crown. The necklace looked more animated but that was fine because I was more concerned with getting the general ideas nailed down. 

## Example #4 - Creating the Designs

For each of the painted elements, I needed example images to create the stencils or mockups for getting designs onto the jumpsuit. When working on the back of the costume, one visual suggestion I liked was to go with a logo-sized sparkplug, I actually used ChatGPT to create the prompt for the image generation. For the image generation I used Nano Banana, Google's image generation model. 

user:
Please create a bold, simple street art stencil design of a crowned spark plug. The style should be rugged and industrial, suitable for spray painting onto the back of a mechanic's jumpsuit. Black silhouette on a white background. Minimal detail, high contrast, chunky shapes. The look of a vintage garage logo.

Once I had the designs I wanted, I traced the outline onto paper, cut through the paper on enough of the lines to make marks on the jumpsuit with a textile pencil, and painted on the designs. 

## Example #5 - Refining Ideas

After painting on the gold chain, I thought it needed a little something to help it pop off the jumpsuit. I uploaded a picture of my progress to ChatGPT and it suggested a medallion with a design on it. I eventually settled on an idea and asked Nano Banana Pro to adjust my uploaded picture to see what it might look like. 

user:
Could you add a golden medallion with the words:
“royal
service” 
in all caps to the necklace?

## Example #6 - Painting Advice

user:
Should I paint a white undercoat to make the colors appear better or would that be too much paint?

ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking:
Good instinct — on dark blue, a white underbase is how you get “bright and crisp” instead of “muddy and transparent.” The risk isn’t the idea, it’s laying it on too thick.

When you should do a white undercoat

Do it only under colors that need to pop:
	•	Purple (especially if you want it bright and saturated)
	•	Any non-metallic gold/yellow (if you’re not using metallic paint)
	•	Small details you want super clean (logos, fleur-de-lis, lettering)

When you don’t need it
	•	Metallic gold fabric paint (like Lumiere-style) usually covers dark fabric well on its own if you do 2 thin coats.
	•	Areas that will flex a lot (knees/elbows) — undercoats add thickness, which can crack sooner.
...

## Example #7 - Links to the Supplies

To get started on the actual costume construction, I asked it to pull together purchase links based on everything we'd discussed.

user: 
Can you give me links to the right paints? Let’s start with white, gold, purple, and black. 

For your 65% poly / 35% cotton jumpsuit, I’d buy Jacquard paints in these exact “jobs”:
	•	White (underbase / brightener): Jacquard Neopaque – White (built for maximum coverage on dark fabric and works well on blends).  ￼
	•	Gold (chain links / metallic pop): Jacquard Lumiere – Metallic Gold (made to cover well even on dark grounds).  ￼
	•	Purple (high-saturation accents): Jacquard Neopaque – Violet (opaque purple that will actually show up on navy).  ￼
	•	Black (outlines/shadows): Jacquard Textile Color – Black (great for linework; super washable).  ￼

## Final Result

Here's the thing nobody tells you about using AI for a project like this: the planning becomes so fast and fluid that you almost forget you still have to do the work. AI helped me find the right paint for a synthetic and cotton blend, suggested a concept that actually fit the garment I had, generated stencil art I could trace, and walked me through layering techniques on dark fabric. All of that probably saved me several days and nights of research, sketches, and false starts.

Painting gold chain links freehand on a jumpsuit at midnight, waiting for coats to dry, messing up a stencil and having to improvise, that part was all me. And it ended up being harder than I expected.

What AI actually gave me was a realistic shot at finishing something that was better than I could have created on my own. It shortened the distance between "vague idea" and "okay, I know exactly what to do and I have everything I need." For a holiday where the whole point is making something yourself, that felt like the right kind of help.
